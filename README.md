- **Time/Word Limit**: Depending on your selected game mode, you can choose a time or word limit.
- **Difficulty**: Select between Easy, Medium, or Hard word difficulty.

The game will start once you press any key. After completing the session, you'll receive feedback on your performance, including your Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and errors.

## Game Modes

Monk-Minal offers three distinct game modes to cater to different practice styles:

1. **Time Mode**: 
   - Focuses on typing for a set duration (15s, 30s, 60s, 120s).
   - Perfect for practicing sustained typing speed over a period of time.

2. **Word Mode**: 
   - Lets you practice typing a specific number of words (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 words).
   - Great for short bursts of typing or focused word count-based exercises.

3. **Quote Mode**: 
   - Type out randomly selected famous quotes.
   - Ideal for those who want a mix of word challenges and inspirational quotes.

## Performance Metrics

Monk-Minal provides real-time feedback and a comprehensive summary of your performance at the end of each session. The performance metrics include:

- **Gross WPM**: The total words typed per minute (including errors).
- **Net WPM**: Adjusted for accuracy, this value represents your effective typing speed after accounting for errors.
- **Accuracy**: A percentage of how many characters you typed correctly, relative to the total characters typed.
- **Errors**: Shows where and how many typing errors were made.

This detailed feedback helps track improvement and gives users actionable insights to enhance their typing skills.

### Game Type

- **Time**: Practice for a set duration.

1. **Easy**: Generates shorter words (up to 5 characters).
2. **Medium**: Generates words with up to 8 characters.
3. **Hard**: Generates complex words of varying lengths (8â€“12 characters), testing your skill and speed.
